# Changelog

All notable changes to **jeo-code** are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The README mirrors the latest 5 entries — regenerate with `bun run changelog:sync`.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-13
_Readability pass for autopilot, subagent activity, and worked-history review._

### Added
- `jeo autopilot status` now renders a yellow ratchet status field with task, eval, score direction, keep/revert counts, patience, and the recommended next action.
- `/history` transcript output now adds turn headers and folds the first tool-result line into each tool activity row, so scrollback reads as user → activity → jeo instead of raw protocol traffic.

### Changed
- Subagent activity lines now render as an `AGENT` tree (`▸ ROLE`, `├─ ROLE`, `└─ ROLE`) in both TUI scrollback and non-TTY progress output for faster scanning.
- README command tables now call out `/history` and `autopilot` as first-class readable operation surfaces.
- Removed the standalone `jeo models` command/menu path; model discovery and assignment now stay inside `/model`, `/provider`, and setup/doctor flows.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-13
_Thinking-loop termination guarantees (cycle guard + turn wall-clock budget), unboxed live status without step counters, self-contained `.jeo` namespace, live next-prompt input card, role-targeted model/thinking picker._

### Added
- Agent-loop cycle guard: an A↔B tool-call ping-pong (re-reading one file ↔ re-running one command forever) now gets ONE corrective bounce, then a hard stop — the "stuck in thinking" spin the exact-repeat guard could never see.
- Turn wall-clock budget (`JEO_TURN_MAX_MS`, default 30 minutes, `0` disables): step budgets bound the COUNT of model calls, this bounds their total TIME — a turn that crosses it consolidates a wrap-up instead of spinning for hours.
- Live next-prompt input box in the TUI — text typed during a running turn stays in the same query surface instead of a separate queued row.
- jeo discovers skills from its own `~/.jeo/agent/skills` (+ project `.jeo/agent/skills`) and resolves hooks/rules under `.jeo` instead of referencing `.gjc`.
- Config-driven custom subagent roles: a non-bundled id declaring `title`/`description`/`prompt` becomes a first-class role at runtime.
- Ctrl+O mid-turn detail view: flush the full last reply + tool output into scrollback.
- `/fast [on|off|status]` slash command: enables minimal/low reasoning fast mode only when the active model advertises support.
- Task/team subagents now receive the same project context block as the parent agent, sourced from `JEO.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.jeo/context.md`, `.agents/*`, and `.jeo/*` guidance — legacy `.gjc` context is not loaded.

### Changed
- Live status is UNBOXED: a flat `⠙ thinking · <live activity> ⟦esc⟧` row plus one dim metrics row replaces the bordered status box — the message is never trapped inside a border.
- Removed meaningless `step N/M` counters everywhere (status row, footer, plain-stream `[step N/M]` headers, nested subagent lines) along with step-driven `eta`/`evo %`: the dynamic step budget keeps extending the denominator, so the counters carried no information. The evolution stage track stays.
- Tool-call signature bookkeeping (repeat/cycle guards, step-budget novelty set) now stores fixed-size FNV digests instead of full JSON argument strings — a long turn's guard memory stays flat even when `write` calls embed whole file bodies.
- Unified model targeting: `/model` can now set default thinking, pick a model, apply it to the default agent or any subagent role, and set that target's thinking level in one flow.
- `/model` picker now shows DEFAULT/role badges with each target's thinking level, and the post-pick action menu uses the unified Set-as-role format plus an OpenAI Codex role preset.
- `/model` action selection now uses a Ralph-style nested sub-list: each DEFAULT/role header expands into selectable thinking rows, so target and thinking are chosen in one TUI screen.
- During a live reasoning turn, typed next-user text now renders as a styled pending `user` card with dark background while the normal input box remains editable.
- Update availability now renders as a yellow full-width field instead of a boxed card, matching the status-field TUI treatment.
- Removed the legacy `/models` slash-menu path; `/model` and `/provider` own interactive model selection.
- Canonicalized runtime naming on `.jeo` and `JEO_` only.

### Fixed
- jeo can no longer sit in "thinking" forever: every turn now terminates via the cycle guard, the wall-clock budget, or the existing step/repeat/failure guards — pathological spins consolidate a wrap-up instead of running unbounded.
- Ctrl-C now force-quits jeo immediately instead of being softened into an abort prompt.
- Done-time todo reconciliation gate — stale Todos can no longer survive a finished turn.
- MCP stdio framing for ralph tools.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-12
_TUI card parity polish + done-time todo reconciliation._

### Added
- gjc card parity: `⟦Ctrl+O for more⟧` clip hint, code highlighting in card bodies, and full tool output via Ctrl+O.

### Fixed
- Clip hint also covers summarize-stage markers.
- Done-time todo reconciliation gate so a finished turn's checklist reflects what actually completed.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-12
_Verified TUI, resilient engine, batch input, multilingual docs._

### Added
- Bracketed-paste batch input — a multi-line paste runs one command per line, in order (prompt_toolkit paste contract).
- jeo-ref transcript parity: Todo Write tree cards, line-numbered write previews, agent-name reasoning blocks, tree-style skill detail.
- Seed writer/parser round-trip integrity with a freeze-time assert.
- Slow-drip stream deadline + acceptance-criteria quality floor.

### Fixed
- Anthropic refusal recovery: context reset per the provider contract, neutral continuation note, OAuth/API-key guidance.
- Model discovery repaired against live endpoints (codex `client_version`, gemini pagination).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-02
_OAuth credentials + local Ollama provider._

### Added
- OAuth login (`jeo auth`) and a local Ollama provider.
- `jeo doctor`, multi-tool-call grouping, and CI/install hardening.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-02
_Setup and model configuration._

### Added
- `jeo setup` and `jeo models`; default Gemini 2.5-flash; verified real LLM turn.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-02
_Real LLM coding agent._

### Added
- Real LLM coding agent with provider + model configuration.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-01
_Initial release._

### Added
- Initial jeo-code agent and CLI.
